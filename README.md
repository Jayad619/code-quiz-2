# code-quiz-2

# Description 
I have created a fun and simple quiz that allows users to test their coding knowledge. When each questions is presented they have a time limit to answer the questions in order to move on. However if the user selects the wrong answer, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. 


# Functionality:
A simple, self explanatory quiz which allows the user to click start, triggering the timer. The first question is displayed on the screen to which the user has to select the correct answer. Failure to do so, will result a deduction of 10 seconds on the timer. The message "incorrect answer" will also be displayed at the same time. In order to move to the next question, the user needs to select the correct answer. Every wrong answer results in a 10second deduction on the timer, once it reaches 0 the game comes to an end.

The user is then taken to another page where they find their final score and they will be asked for their initals. When the user clicks submit they will have submitted their highscore to a score board, the user then has the option to clear this highscore and go back to start the quiz again.
